# ðŸ“˜ Java DSA Interview Prep

This repository contains Java implementations of frequently asked **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems in technical interviews. Each solution prioritizes **clarity**, **performance**, and **readability**. Where relevant, both **brute-force** and **optimized** approaches are included, along with **time and space complexity analysis**.
