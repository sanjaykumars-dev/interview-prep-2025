# Java DSA Interview Prep

This repository contains Java implementations of popular Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, commonly asked in technical interviews.

Each solution is optimized for clarity, performance, and readability. Wherever applicable, both brute-force and optimized approaches are included, with time and space complexity analysis.

## ðŸ§  How to Use
- Each topic is organized under its respective package in `src/`.
- Run individual classes with a `main` method to test.
- Use this as a study reference or a base to expand into more advanced topics.

## ðŸš€ Goal
Prepare for top-tier software engineering interviews (24+ LPA roles) by building a strong foundation in core DSA concepts using Java.
